	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. It helps us evaluate how efficient an algorithm is, especially when handling large datasets. Understanding time complexity is essential for comparing algorithms and selecting the most optimal one for performance.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory space an algorithm uses relative to the input size. It indicates how much additional memory is needed to execute a program. For instance, an algorithm that stores all input values in an array has a Space Complexity of O(n), where n is the number of inputs.</p>
