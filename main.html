	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of its input size. Efficiency in algorithms is measured by how quickly they execute, often aiming to minimize time complexity. Common time complexities include O(1) (constant), O(n) (linear), and O(log n) (logarithmic), with lower complexities being more efficient for larger inputs.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. An algorithm with O(n) space complexity grows linearly with the input size, meaning it requires memory proportional to the number of elements processed.</p>
